#### Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
In this problem, you are given an original image I, as shown in Fig. 1. Please follow the instructions below to create several images.


- (a) Write the DFT subroutine (with origin shifted) and perform it on image I. Show the output as F1 with log transformation and output the execution time.
- (b) Explain the phenomenon of the result in (a). Provide some discussions on the results. What happens if the origin is not shifted?
- (c) Write the IDFT (Inverse DFT) subroutine and perform it on F1. Output the result as F2 and justify your result and show the execution time.
